Enhancement Name	Description

Weight of Items		Each item from item.txt can be assigned a weight. The player has a designated maximum weight of
gameplay1.txt		carryable items. A check if performed before each item is picked up if it goes above the limit
					created by the maximum weight to prevent the player from picking up any item they please. This
					creates the element of weight based inventory management. The current carry weight of items being
					carried as well as the maximum weight can be seen from the "Carry Weight" option in the menu.
					This adds a layer of decision making as the sum of the weight of the items you need to bring into
					your exam is equal to your initial max carry weight, therefore if you are aiming for a higher score
					you will need to drop the exam items and pick them up later.

Swappable Items		Certain items are able to be swapped for other items that are otherwise unavailable.
gameplay2.txt		This makes the player evaluate the importance of each item and decide which one would
					be best to keep and whether they should waste their limited moves and find out whether or
					nor this item can be swapped for.

Security Check		Before the exam room can be entered and the exam can be written, a security guard will check the
gameplay3.txt		player. The player will be checked for the minimum items required to enter the exam room and also
					whether any banned items are in the player's inventory. The player has 2 attempts to pass this check
					before the security officer kicks the player out and the player misses their exam(game ends).
					This allows for an extra layer of difficulty as if even if you have a high score and you attempt
					to go to the exam, your game will end and you will still lose.

Inspectable Items	Any item from the player's inventory can be inspected from the menu. If the player is unsure of
gameplay4.tx		the purpose of a specific item then they may receive a hint when they inspect the specific item.

Dangerous
Individual			The player can approach a dangerous individual. This individual will offer the player a swap
Puzzle				if they answer a riddle. This individual will give an item that is not available via pick up
gameplay5.txt		anywhere on the map and will also relieve a burden off the player(the knife). The player has
					2 encounters with this mysterious individual, each asking a different riddle. The bonus item
					that can be rewarded will be extremely beneficial to the player's exam score.

Droppable Items		Any item from the player's inventory can be dropped. The dropped item will stay at the dropped
gameplay6.txt		location. The player can move around freely and return to the location at any time and pick the
					dropped item back up into their inventory and remove it from the location inventory.

Accessibility		Accessibility levels (attributes of each location object) were a unique way that we were able to work
					around hard coding events into certain location numbers. Accessibilty level 1 mans basic commands
					such as go, drop, and pick up are allowed in this location. Accessibility level 0 means that an item
					exists in this location however you cannot pick up or drop an item in this location. In order to
					get this item you must �swap� (equivalent to trade) for it. Accessibility level 2 means that an
					event is occurring in this location and you cannot move past this location until you complete this
					event. Here you cannot drop or pick up items as well. Accessibility level 3 means all commands are blocked
					because you are in the exam room, and you have all the necessary items in order to win.
					Finally accessibility level 4 means that there is an event in this location, however it can be ignored
					if the player choses to do so. Once again the player cannot drop or pickup items.
